# Personal page

Run `hugo` in this directory to to build the page manually. The website files are generated in `public/` and can be copied at the root of the website. 

You need to set the proper base URL in [config.toml](config.toml)

The styling and responsive layout are based on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com). The font used is Google Fonts' [Chivo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Chivo).

N.B.: the social-media card is not automatically generated. Rather, the idea is to generate the twitter-card page and then take a screenshot. To display this page, build or preview the website including drafts (run `hugo -D` or `hugo server -D`).
