I am a data scientist at the World Health Organization Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence in Berlin, Germany. A physics graduate, with PhD, of the École normale supérieure, I have worked as a mathematical modeller, coder and developer in fundamental and applied research. My main domains of expertise are physics, infectious-disease surveillance and epidemiology. Experimental biology and visual arts have also been part of my professional life. 

This led me to live and work in five cities in four countries, and speak three languages fluently. I love that data science is a transversal discipline, that allows one to work on diverse topics and collaborate with people from all walks of life.

I use the pronouns he/him.
