            <h2>biography</h2>

            <p>I am an independent data scientist and consultant based in Berlin, Germany. A physics graduate, with PhD, of the École normale supérieure, I have worked as a mathematical modeller, coder and developer in fundamental and applied research. My main domains of expertise are physics, infectious-disease surveillance and epidemiology. Experimental biology and visual arts have also been part of my professional life.</p>
<p>This lead me to live and work in five cities in four countries, and speak three languages fluently. I use the pronouns he/him. A full curriculum vitae in English can be downloaded <a href="

/docs/cv-ghozzi.pdf">here</a> (pdf).</p>
<p>My training and the beginning of my professional career were dedicated to scientific research in physics.</p>
<p>I graduated from the École normale supérieure in Paris, France, in theoretical particle and statistical physics. After a Master of Arts in computer animation at the École nationale des Arts des décoratifs, Paris, I went back to scientific research and did a PhD on the experimental characterization of noise propagation in gene regulatory networks. After eight years in Paris, I came to Germany for a postdoc in Cologne on the mathematical modeling of bacterial fitness landscape and human-influenza evolution. Measurement errors and uncertainty quantification were central topics of my work in physics.</p>
<p>I worked as visual artist for a while (a pdf portfolio as of 2014 can be downloaded <a href="

/docs/portfolio-ghozzi.pdf">here</a>) before getting interested by machine learning for health: A lot was happening there and it was, technically speaking, quite close to what I knew from physics. What I did discover though and interested me particularly were the techniques and applications of quantitative model evaluation. My data-science career proper started when I joined the Robert Koch Institute, Germany&rsquo;s national public-health agency.</p>
<p>Over a few years at RKI, my colleagues and I set up and grew a data-science team that developed and maintained analysis pipelines and dashboards for infectious-disease surveillance. To be relevant, this necessitated a constant dialogue with domain experts: epidemiologists as well as public-health agents. I grew more and more aware of societal aspects of data-collection and analysis software, especially given the sensitivity of population-health surveillance. At that time pioneering work about what is broadly called &ldquo;AI ethics&rdquo; was gaining widespread attention.</p>
<p>My work at the World Health Organization and at the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research continued and expanded this approach. My work came to be relevant for many different populations. I also came in contact with many different data sources and types, software, and topics beyond infectious disease.</p>
<p>This confirmed to me that data science, from data collection and processing to statistical analysis and machine learning, to data visualization and interactive dashboards, was, in fact, a transversal topic to a variety of domains, and was often needed in self-contained projects. Thus, working as an independent developer and consultant was the best way for me to contribute to society as a data scientist.</p>
